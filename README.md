# Phone Entropy Chain 🌀📱🔊

A deranged circle of doom: Line up 20+ smartphones in a ring. One starts with a crisp audio clip (your voice? A banger beat? Cthulhu whispers?). Each phone records the incoming sound from the previous one's speaker, mangles it with digital decay (filters, noise, pitch wobbles), and passes the abomination to the next. By the end? Pure auditory apocalypse—like telephone game on bath salts.

Inspired by analog horror and signal entropy. Built for viral TikToks, art installs, or just watching tech weep.
